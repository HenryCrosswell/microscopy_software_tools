# Automated Analysis Tools for Light Microscopy Data

## Overview
This repository contains the codebase for the project "Automated Analysis Tools for Light Microscopy Data." The goal of this project is to develop software that enables researchers to efficiently preprocess, segment, and visualize light microscopy datasets. The tools are designed to support both the Sainsbury Wellcome Centre (SWC) Neuroinformatics Unit (NIU) and Advanced Microscopy facilities (AMF) for various microscopy imaging tasks.

## Features
- Image preprocessing including noise reduction, background correction, and image registration.
- Automated cell segmentation using techniques such as thresholding and watershed.
- Interactive data visualization for exploring and analyzing microscopy images.
- Integration with computational neuroanatomy tools from the BrainGlobe initiative.
- Detailed documentation and tutorials for using the software effectively.
- Optimized performance for processing large microscopy datasets.
- Collaborative support and guidance for researchers using the tools.
